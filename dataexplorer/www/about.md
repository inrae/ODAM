### Give an open access to your data and make them ready to be mined - A data explorer as bonus

[![Badge](biotools-ODAM-blue.svg)](https://bio.tools/ODAM)<br><br>

ODAM (Open Data for Access and Mining) is an Experimental data table management software (EDTMS) to make research data accessible and available for reuse with minimal effort on the part of the data provider. Designed to manage experimental data tables in an easy way for users, ODAM provides a model for structuring both data and metadata that facilitates data handling and analysis. It also encourages data dissemination according to FAIR principles by making the data interoperable and reusable by both humans and machines, allowing the dataset to be explored and then extracted in whole or in part as needed.<br>

#### Test online with the <a href="?ds=frim1">FRIM dataset</a>
----

* Test online the getData API through the web <a href="https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/odamsw/" target="_blank">swagger UI</a> (See <a href="https://github.com/inrae/ODAM/tree/master/API" target="_blank">Github ODAM/API</a> )

* For open data access throught web services 
      - with R : see  the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rodam/vignettes/Rodam.html" target="_blank">R ODAM package and How to use it</a>
      - within Jupyter notebook : see  the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/djacob65/binder_odam/tree/master/" target="_blank">Examples with R and Python using Jupyter nbviewer</a>

<br>

* All ontology terms were picked from <a href="http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/"  target="_blank">AgroPortal</a> and especially by levering on their very useful <a href="http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/annotator" target="_blank">Annotator module
